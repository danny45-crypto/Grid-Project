                    "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers,working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

                    "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encourgared to enroll by former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project,in particular,was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact,I've often referred to it during interviews as ana example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
